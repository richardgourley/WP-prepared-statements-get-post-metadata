# WP PREPARED STATEMENTS AND GET POST META DATA
## How to use the WPDB prepared function for prepared statements.
## How to use the WP function get_post_meta to get meta data for each post type.

The aim of this is to give a reference for anyone looking how to use the WPDB prepare function.  It is very similar in appearance and action to working with PDO in PHP.
This is also a reference on how to get post meta data when working with custom post types in Wordpress.

In the examples in this repository, we are working with a CUSTOM POST TYPE (see other repositories to refer to how to create custom post types in Wordpress) called SERVICES OFFERED. We simple have set up this custom post type to hold info for each service offered by a company, in this case:
- Price
- Our promise

An example output would look like this:
## Roofing

## Prices from: $27

## Our promise: We offer professional fast roofing services. We will deliver way beyond your expectations.
